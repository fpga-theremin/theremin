<h1>FPGA Based Theremin Project: : Cabinet and Antennas</h1>

<p>Almost any solution which is big enough to fit all PCBs is suitable for this project.</p>
<p>One of possible designs of cabinet, antennas and mic stand mount is described here.</p>

<h2>&quot;Pipe Monster&quot;</h2>
<p>This design is called Pipe Monster because it looks a bit ugly.</p>
<p>Theremin antenna are often made of water or gas pipes. Why not go deeper, and add more pipes?</p>

<p>This build is very simple. It's based on polypropylene water pipes and fittings.</p>
<p>Ehterwave antennas can be used as well.</p>

<p>You will need some polypropylene fittings and 20mm tubes. Fittings are with 1/2&quot; thread.</p>

<p>Actual design may vary a lot.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Choose one or two points of volume antenna mounting.</li>
   <li>If you mount volume antenna with two fittings, it makes sense to choose distance between mount points to be close to 85mm as in Ehterwave.</li>
   <li>Middle fitting with 1/2 inch female thread is used to mount on mic stand.</li>
   <li>At left and right there are the same fittings for mounting of cabinet box. Choose distance between them based on box dimensions.</li>
   <li>It's possible to mount box under some small angle towards player - for better visibility of screen.</li>
   <li>Distance between antennas should be near 40-50cm.</li>
   <li>Fittings at antenna mount points may vary depending on found antennas.</li>
</ul>
